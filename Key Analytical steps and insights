Key Analytical Steps and Insights:
Data Loading and Overview:

The dataset contains 1,470 employees with 35 attributes such as age, department, job role, satisfaction levels, and more.
Attrition Filtering:

The notebook specifically focuses on employees with attrition (df['Attrition'] == 'Yes'), allowing the analysis of factors that contribute to employee turnover.
Important Variables Analyzed:

The dataset explores factors such as WorkLifeBalance, TotalWorkingYears, JobSatisfaction, JobInvolvement, and YearsAtCompany to understand their correlation with attrition.
You can emphasize the investigation into attributes that might be predictive of employee turnover, such as satisfaction levels, training opportunities, or years in current role.


           Overall  Conclusions :-

Work-Life Balance & Job Satisfaction: Employees with lower job satisfaction and work-life balance tend to show higher attrition rates. Companies should focus on improving these areas to retain talent.
Years at Company vs. Attrition: Many employees leaving had shorter tenure, indicating the need for better onboarding, engagement, and career growth strategies during early employment stages.

Training and Development: Employees who had fewer training opportunities in the last year were more likely to leave, highlighting the importance of continuous skill development.
Managerial Support: Employees with fewer years with the current manager or a lack of promotions might be more likely to quit, suggesting that strong managerial relationships and career progression opportunities can reduce attrition.
