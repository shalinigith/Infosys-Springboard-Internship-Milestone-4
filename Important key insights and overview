 [Key Insights:]
High Attrition in Sales and R&D:

Department-wise Attrition: Sales and Research & Development (R&D) departments are experiencing the highest attrition rates, at 39% and 56% respectively. This could indicate issues related to job satisfaction, work pressure, or lack of career advancement opportunities in these high-stress departments.
Attrition Among Sales Roles:

Attrition by Job Role: The roles of Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, and Research Scientist have the highest numbers of attrition, suggesting that roles involving high demand and potentially high stress are more prone to turnover. Strategies to improve job satisfaction and work conditions in these roles might be beneficial.
Gender Disparity in Attrition:

Attrition by Gender: There's a noticeable disparity in attrition between genders, with 150 males leaving compared to 87 females. This might require further investigation into whether there are underlying factors or specific issues affecting male employees disproportionately.
Education Field Impact:

Education Field Wise Attrition: Employees with backgrounds in Life Sciences and Medical fields show higher attrition rates (38% and 27% respectively). This could be due to external market factors like better opportunities outside or specific demands and stress related to these fields.
Years at Company and Attrition:

Years at Company vs Attrition: Thereâ€™s a peak in attrition at 5 years of tenure, which often marks the end of certain vesting periods of benefits or stock options, indicating this as a critical period for employee retention strategies.



        [Conclusions:]
